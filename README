ltxpost - a latex post filter command to support change bars
and overstrike mode.

Compiling ltxpost:

make

Use of ltxpost:

latex <name>[.tex]
ltxpost <name>.dvi <name>.dvi

note: ltxpost alllows to use the same name for input and output.
A second call to ltxpost does not change the file.

The interface:

\usepackage{dvipost}

The following macro must be called if any layout parameter
like \evensidemargin ... is changed after including dvipost.sty.

\dvipostlayout

change bars:

\changestart Text marked as changed \changeend
\textchanged{Text marked as changed}

overstrike mode:

\overstrikeon Overstriked text \overstrikeoff
\overstrike{Overstriked text}

Additional to this modes, ltxpost allows to display the
page layout. This is done by calling

\dvipost{layout=<length>}

with <length> > 0. ltxpost accepts lengths in pt, in, mm and cm.

You can also use tex lengths in combination with the \the command:

\dvipost{layout=\the\fboxrule}

Have a look at dvipost.sty and test.tex to see more details
of the interface.
