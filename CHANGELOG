Version 0.9:

Added autoconf script to create Makefile. To make dvipost,
do the following:

configure	# create Makefile
make		# create binaries
make test	# run test (optional)
make install	# install binaries and styles (may need root privileges)

Support for interactive running (la)tex: Run dvipost
on all *.dvi files which are changed after running (la)tex.

Support for old teTeX versions which have a different
syntax of running latex (no options allowed) and kpsewhich
(needs type of requested file as first argument).
(for example: teTeX 0.3.4).

Fixed some missing headers in source files.

Testet under AIX 3.2 with xlc.
